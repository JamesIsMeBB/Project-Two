				Arizona high schools – where teen dating violence typically begins – have an 
				  astounding lack of school enacted preventative measures. 7.6 percent of high school students reports 
				  physical dating violence in Arizona and 8.6 percent of Arizona high school students also reports sexual 
				  violence (CDC, 2019). Even schools with mitigation tactics or victim resources still do not meet what should 
				  be requisite: prevention. 
				</p>
				<p class="line-space-normal">
				It should be noted that youth dating violence is also not a problem that victims can dependably overcome 
				themselves; it is not a problem that will simply be grown out of for perpetrators nor is it a problem contained 
				within a vacuum. Youth dating violence has led to the death of 227 youth under the age of 24 from 2008 – 2018. 
				People die because of this.  Without prevention, youth dating violence perpetuates itself as “…engagement in 
				violence is a strong predictor of future violent behaviors. For example, youth who are both victims and
				perpetrators of bullying are at an increased risk for delinquency and violence over time” 
				(Vivolo-Kantor et al., 2021). Violence once is a sign of violence again. People don’t just grow out of solidly 
				established behaviors but rather they linger like bad habits and stay low to the ground of the mind. This 
				issue takes sturdy, thorough, preventative, immediate action if we ever hope to prevent the violence in our 
				schools and upon our youth, if we hope to save lives. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="collapse tm-intro-text mb-4" id="collapsing2">
				<p class="line-space-normal">
				Other groups in Arizona, such as Bloom365, have begun the realization within the state that youth dating 
				violence requires more than mitigation but requires a personal involvement of the peers within the context 
				of the issue (Bloom365, 2021). Unfortunately – though this is difficult – these groups have yet to largely 
				break into breeding grounds for a majority of the teen dating violence: high schools. If the counselors of 
				GUHSD give teens the opportunity work together, a powerful and influential change can be made across the youth.

                  Arizona’s youth suffer from the social plague known as youth dating violence. 
				  This has been a recognized problem from the Arizona government itself; Governor Doug Ducey declared 
				  February “Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month,” with supporting statements such as 
				  “…teen dating violence crosses race, gender, and socioeconomic lines,” (Governor’s Office of Youth,
				  Faith and Family, 2020).

                <p class="mb-5 tm-intro-text">
				Non-existent prevention in the Arizona high schools is the precursor to rampant 
				  youth dating abuse where at-risk teens are allowed to perpetrate or be victimized. This lack of uniform 
				  prevention is why this proposal will speak directly to the counselors of the Glendale Union High School 
				  District on establishing an afterschool club for prevention of youth dating violence within high schools. 
				  This club will be geared towards at-risk teens – though anyone may join to participate – with a focus on 
				  peer-led education, discussion, leadership, and engagement.

						<p>The solution is a peer-led (peers meaning peers of the age group and peers involved in the solution) 
						club where peers can lead research, education, activities and discussion. This club should be sponsored 
						by a high school counselor willing to endorse the club and facilitate meetings. The club should be open 
						to all but any potential or active victims or perpetrators of youth dating violence (at-risk) should be 
						referred into the club by the school counselors. The club should be engaging and eye opening for all 
						participants through open discussion, relevant education, and participatory activities. Lastly, members 
						should be encouraged to be mindful of club education and apply what they can to their lives.

						<h4 class="tm-text-primary">Why a Club?</h4>
						<p>
						A first question that may is, “Why do we need a club to begin with?” Journal of School Health research 
						asserted that, “Given that few youth seek help on their own, schools might create more formalized 
						reporting mechanisms to ensure such violence is addressed effectively and efficiently, and create peer
						and parental support networks to build awareness and create comfort for victims” (Lachman, Zweig, Dank,
						Yagner, 2019). The youth of high schools, including GUHSD (Glendale Union High School District), are not
						speaking up on this violence and this is from an obvious absence of peer-support networks.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12 mb-2">
					<div>
						<p>
						The CDC also 
						recognizes that youth dating violence requires early education that can serve as prevention when they 
						say, “During the pre-teen and teen years, it is critical for youth to begin learning the skills needed 
						to create and maintain healthy relationships. These skills include knowing how to manage feelings and
						how to communicate in a healthy way” (2020).

						<h4 class="tm-text-primary">A Peer-Led Approach</h4>
						<p>
						By far, the most vital component to this prevention program is a peer-led approach. This solution 
						advocates for peer-led discussions and research and education and more, but why? According to the 
						Journal of School Health, “Previous research has shown that teen dating violence victims are most 
						likely to seek out informal sources of help, especially their friends and parents” (Lachman et al.,2019).
						In addition, this same research indicates that a sweeping 77.2 percent of victims sought help from 
						friends and only 16.8 percent. Any other sources to which victims may report to fall far below the 
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12 mb-2">
					<div>
						<p>
						above 
						percentages (Lachman et al., 2019). This simple research presented is a blatant sign of what is 
						occurring when victims of youth dating violence seek help: they confide in peers. From here a leading 
						question should be asked, “How can we incorporate a solution that involves peers and ensures peers are 
						informed to take the proper and responsible actions to help?”
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="mt-5">
						<h4 class="tm-text-primary">Education</h4>
						<p>The answer is education, education that is served over time and education that deals out information 
						on self-respect, healthy relationships, and other useful tools toward prevention. The education must be 
						engaging, respectful, researched, and most importantly, peer-involved. Prevention Science holds research 
						on a CDC developed group, Dating Matters®, which incorporated education as a key role as well. According 
						to this research, “Results demonstrated that both male and female students attending schools implementing
						Dating Matters reported 11% less bullying perpetration and 11% less physical violence perpetration than 
						students in comparison schools” (Vivolo-Kantor et al., 2021). Education proved widely successful and the 
						implementation was, “…repeated exposure to these lessons over the 3 years of middle school…” which 
						further supports the argument of early adaptation of education over time (Vivolo-Kantor et al., 2021). 
						Education can’t be served out periphrastically to the entirety of a school in an impersonal one-time 
						assembly of sorts. Another group from Prevention Medicine was the ERSG program; this program gives more
						reason to personal education over time as its “…curriculum includes five multi-session units…” and 
						throughout, “There were incremental reductions in reactive and proactive aggression, psychological and 
						sexual perpetration, and psychological, physical, and sexual victimization…” (Reidy, Holland, Cortina, 
						Ball, Rosenbluth, 2017).  
						</br></br>It must be emphasized that the education must be peer-driven if it ever wishes to have an impact 
						that is valuable. Additional support for a peer-led education that is developed and given through peers 
						is through the Journal of Family Violence on the Start Strong Boston group. It was demonstrated that 
						“The program utilizes peer-led education and youth empowerment strategies to engage adolescents in all 
						aspects of program development and implementation. These methods were chosen to deepen participants' 
						acceptance and retention of healthy relationship messaging topics” and this approach was widely engaging 
						and feasible (Beatriz et al., 2018). The reasoning behind this novel approach was given, “By including 
						Boston adolescents in every part of the programming, from planning to implementation to evaluation 
						(the focus of the present manuscript), the program goes beyond talking about adolescents, to talking 
						to them and with them. Having Peer Leaders be part of the solution to the very serious issue of teen 
						dating violence benefits both them and the participants in the program” (Beatriz et al., 2018). It is 
						clear that education, over time, which is peer-led and engaging, serves as a robust catalyst to change 
						in youth dating violence. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="mt-5">
						<h4 class="tm-text-primary">Alternatives</h4>
						<p>“Let’s just have an assembly with the entire student body at once and get the education across 
						quick and easy,” or “Let’s just make a class for this sort of thing.” Both of these solutions lack 
						the central component of success: peer-led solution. Without addressing every issue of each suggestion,
						these alternatives will already prove to be weak through their lack of peer-involvement. It has already
						been proven above that peer-involvement plays an instrumental role in successful youth dating violence 
						prevention. Apart from this, an assembly does not engage students nor does it cement any knowledge as it
						does not expand its education out over enough time. The class alternative could prove successful to 
						some extent – depending on design – but is much more difficult to incorporate into a GUHSD high school 
						then a club. All-in-all, a club is streamlined, cheap, customizable, engaging, and peer-led; all-in-all 
						a club is the most effective solution. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
					<div class="mt-5">
						<h4 class="tm-text-primary">In Closing</h4>
						<p>The wonderful part of all of this is the personalization that can be had so that a solution may be 
						tailored specially for every high school student body. Peer-led research, club development, discussions, 
						and activities are facets for customization. The club can hold the interest of that particular student 
						body and work for that particular school as the club, its organization, operations, education, and 
						activities can all be done in a way that fits best. So long as the central ideas of education and 
						peer-led advocacy are sustained, the club can prove to be vastly more successful than any mitigation 
						tactic.

				“This solution can’t stop active violence, there will always be someone who falls through the cracks,”

						It’s true, no club can wholly stop all ongoing violence in the moment and there may always be at least 
						one victim, at least for some time after implementation. Though it should be noted that this proposal was 
						never made in hopes that all other mitigation tactics and help resources should be eliminated. This club

						This club will solve the puzzle through a peer-led mindset that could be asserted as not feasible, 
						reasonable, or possible. Earlier the Start Strong Boston group was examined; this group was the most 
						pervasive of all other examined groups in peer-involved development, mentoring, and leadership. 
						The research conduct on Start Strong Boston clearly stated, “…we demonstrate that the inclusion of youth 
						Peer Researchers in the design and conduct of the evaluation of an after-school based TDV prevention program 
						for middle-school youth is both acceptable and feasible” (Beatriz et al., 2018). It may seem easy to call 
						the youth of high schools incompetent and it may be easy to assume their failure, but it takes a change 
						within the system to bring about long lasting resolution. Start Strong Boston proved the validity of 
						peer-structured movements and it is up to us to implement the best solution with powerful impacts.

							If nothing else, the solution could fall short if it intersects with logistical obstacles such as a lack

                As a counselor, simply consider this solution. Consider the benefit that could be had across the board. 
				Consider sponsoring a prevention club and facilitating club meetings. Consider seeking out at-risk youth who 
				could join and consider seeking youth who could stand up as leaders as well. Consider spreading awareness 
				yourself to the student body through the attached advertisement on the school bulletin boards. 
				</br></br>There are simple steps that can be taken as a counselor to get the club off the ground: 
				sponsor and initialize a prevention club, seek out students who would be interested in being initial 
				peer leaders, spread the For Friends advertisement and put together a list of at-risk teens, then hold 
				the first meeting. The first meeting and onward will involve working with all members to build a curriculum
				of what is important to them, what their issues are, and what will benefit them the most. Along with this, 
				other club operations and activities can and should be discussed. Your peer leaders (all members should be 
				encouraged to lead education and or discussion at one point or another) will be your indispensable partners 
				in helping the students you care for. This will take time and patience but these actions are a basis for success.
				</br></br>As a counselor – in your position who cares for their students – it becomes your responsibility to advocate 
				for their well-being just as much as it is their own responsibility. Do you accept this responsibility and with
				it the power to save lives?
